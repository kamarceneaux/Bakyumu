## Project Goal
A remote-controlled cleaning robot with a simple user
interface (UI). The robot is able to vacuum in small pieces of
debris, such as small pieces of paper and dust, while being
controlled by the user via a web application by connecting
the robot via Wi-Fi on a personal device.

## Constraints
This is designed to be a very simple robot. We had a $100 budget and 4 weeks to plan and build this robot. You can learn more about our planning through out slide deck.
